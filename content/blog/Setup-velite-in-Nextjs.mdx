## Introduction

In modern development era almost everyone are writing blogs on their own personal websites. Most of them are doing it cause they love doing it (Like me ) So in This blog i will provide a guide to setting up Velite which can take some time setting up but is very rewarding as Velite allows us to write our blogs in `.mdx` files So everything is available locally + it loads like a cheetah you can read more about velite [here](https://velite.js.org/guide/introduction)

In this b log i will be going over the setup i am using for the blog you can see right now so let's begin.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of markdown language cuz DUH
- A Nextjs project up and ready you can create one in second using my template [[My NextJs Template]]
- Presense of mind cuz I heard it's important

## Section 1.1

In the root directory of your project add velite as a dependency

<PreCard pwd='shell'>
```shell
pnpm add velite
```

</PreCard>

Using Velite, we can define schemas for various uses. For instance, we can have separate schemas for the blog, doc, and guide sections. All these schemas are collectively defined inside a collection. Let's define a schema for blog posts:

<PreCard pwd='./velite.config.ts'>
```json
import { defineCollection, defineConfig, s } from 'velite';

const computedFields = <T extends { slug: string }>(data: T) => ({
...data,
slugAsParams: data.slug.split("/").slice(1).join("/"),
});

const posts = defineCollection({
name: "Post",
pattern: "blog/\*_/_.mdx",
schema: s.object({
slug: s.path(),
title: s.string().max(99),
description: s.string().max(999).optional(),
date: s.isodate(),
published: s.boolean().default(true),
banner: s.string().max(99),
body: s.mdx(),
}).transform(computedFields),
});

export default defineConfig({
  root: "content",
  output: {
    data: "./.velite",
    assets: "public/static",
    base: "/static/",
    name: "[name].[hash:6].[ext",
    clean: true,
  },
  collections: { posts },
  mdx: {},
});
```
</PreCard>

- \*\*Define Collection

  - Using `zod`, we define a schema for the `posts` collection.
  - The schema includes fields such as `slug`, `title`, `description`, `date`, `published`, `banner`, and `body`.
  - The `computedFields` object is used to transform the `slug` field, making it easier to query in the future.

- **Define Config **
  - The `defineConfig` function dictates how files are stored and accessed.
  - **Root**: Specifies where the `mdx` files are stored.
  - **Data**: Indicates the folder used to store the compiled `mdx` files.
  - **Assets**: Specifies where to search for images used in the `mdx` files.
  - **Output Format**: Defines the format in which the output file is generated.

velite supports the use of rehype plugins which would help us with the color formatting etc this is optional as you can still customize how every components look from scratch
To use the plugins install this dependencies

<PreCard pwd="shell">
  ```js pnpm add rehype-autolink-headings rehype-pretty-code rehype-slug ```
</PreCard>

and we just have to pass these as a object in the mdx field

<PreCard pwd='./velite.config.ts'>
```ts
**Everything from above**
mdx:{
	rehypePlugins:[
	rehypeSlug as any,
	[rehypePrettyCode,{theme:"catppuccin-mocha"}],
	[rehypeAutolinkHeadings,{
properties:{
className:["subheading-anchor"],
ariaLabel:"Link to heading"
}}]]}
```
</PreCard>

A good thing to do would be to add .velite folder in the .gitignore file

## Section 1.2 Modify next.config.js

the official velite docs suggests to modify the nnext.config.js file into this

<PreCard pwd='./nextconfig.json'>
```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line import/extensions
await import("./src/env.js");
const isDev = process.argv.indexOf('dev') !== -1
const isBuild = process.argv.indexOf('build') !== -1
if (!process.env.VELITE_STARTED && (isDev || isBuild)) {
process.env.VELITE_STARTED = '1'
const { build } = await import('velite')
await build({ watch: isDev, clean: !isDev })
}
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
class VeliteWebpackPlugin {
static started = false
apply(/** @type {import('webpack').Compiler} */ compiler) {
// executed three times in nextjs
// twice for the server (nodejs / edge runtime) and once for the client
compiler.hooks.beforeCompile.tapPromise('VeliteWebpackPlugin', async () => {
if (VeliteWebpackPlugin.started) return
VeliteWebpackPlugin.started = true
const dev = compiler.options.mode === 'development'
const { build } = await import('velite')
await build({ watch: dev, clean: !dev })
})
}
}
/** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
const config = {};
export default config;
```

</PreCard>

What i understood was this was to recompile velite eachtime we made a change in our document.
Now lets try out whether this worked out or not We still got a long way to go but don't give up now.

In the root directory run

<PreCard pwd="shell">
  ```shell mkdir content/blog cd content/blog touch test.mdx ```
</PreCard>

in the test.mdx create a test document

<PreCard pwd='./content/blog/test.mdx'>
```mdx

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

````

Now in the terminal Run
</PreCard>

<PreCard pwd='shell'>
```shell
npx velite
````

</PreCard>

Now we should see a new folder .velite in the home directory and we can see the compiled mdx file.
I would suggest creating a alias to access this files from anywhere in the directory
In the tsconfig.json add a new alias

<PreCard pwd='tsconfig.json'>
```js
{
"compilerOptions":{
	"paths": {
		"@/*": ["./src/*"],
		"#site/content":["./.velite"]
},}
}
```
</PreCard>

Now lets tests out whether we can access the notes

<PreCard pwd='./src/app/page.tsx'>
```js
import {posts} from '#site/config'
const page = () => {
return (
<div>
{posts.map((post)=>(
<h1>{post.title}</h1>
<p>{post.description}</p>
))}
</div>
)
}
export default page
```

</PreCard>

## Conclusion

now run the server and see the chages....Not soo awesome eh?
As i said we still have a bit to go now try displaying the content of the post BOOM it doenst makes sense right? Dont worry in the second part of the blog we will setup this to the end and make the blog look like the way it's doing here till then see ya
