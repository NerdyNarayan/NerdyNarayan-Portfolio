## Introduction

Before diving into the concept of a linked list, imagine the workings of your top navigation bar in your browser with the back (`<`) and forward (`>`) buttons. This is a practical implementation of a linked list. Now, let's think about how we would create something similar using an array.

1. Create an array of fixed size.
2. The first element of the array points to the home page.

```cpp
["google.com"]
```

3. Whenever a user clicks on a new page, it is added to the array:

```cpp
["google.com", "youtube.com", "github.com"]
```

Now, suppose we want to go back to google.com and then visit reddit.com. We can't just insert an element between google.com and youtube.com in an array because it requires the exact next memory location to be empty, which is not guaranteed. This leads to memory issues and complexity.

This problem is solved using a linked list. In a linked list, each element (node) knows the next one, allowing us to easily add or remove elements without worrying about contiguous memory. This adaptability is the essence of a linked list.

In simple terms

> A linked list is a collection of **nodes**, where each node contains **data** and a **pointer** to the next node. This structure allows for easily adding and deleting elements without worrying about contiguous memory allocation. The pointers can point to different memory locations in the heap, and we can create new connections between nodes by modifying the pointer addresses to point to new nodes.

## Creating a Node

A linked list is a data structure that contains two crucial pieces of information. The data[Actual Information] and a pointer[pointing to the next data location] This collectively is called a **Node**.

We can create a Node using classes in Cpp

<PreCard pwd="LinkedList.cpp">

```cpp
  class Node{
    public{
      int data;
      Node* next;
    }
  }
```

</PreCard>
We can create aditonal constructors for cases where we only want to put the data or when we want to put both the data and the next pointer.
<PreCard pwd="LinkedList.cpp">

```cpp
public:
  Node(int val){
    data = val;
    next = nullptr;
  }
  Node(int val, Node* nextNode){
    data = val;
    next = nextNode;
  }
```

</PreCard>

### Some conditions we can perform on Nodes

1.  Check if last node is reached

    ```c

    if(p->next==NULL)

    ```

2.  Check if ptr is not pointing to any node

    ```c

    if(p==NULL)
    if(p==0)
    if(!p)

    ```

3.  Check if ptr is pointing to any node

    ```c

    if(p!=NULL)
    if(p!=0)
    if(p)

    ```

## Creating a linked List

We create a linked list by creating the first node and point it to the next node of the list.

<PreCard pwd="LinkedList.cpp">

```cpp

  Node* head = new Node();
  head->data = 10;
  head->next = NULL;

```

</PreCard>
And if we want to extend the linked list we just create a new node and point the next of the last node to the new node.

<PreCard pwd="LinkedList.cpp">
```cpp

Node* newNode = new Node();
newNode->data = 20;
newNode->next = NULL;
head->next = newNode;

```
</PreCard>
  
we could also turn a array to a linked list


<PreCard pwd="LinkedList.cpp">

```cpp
  #include<vector>
  int main() {
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    Node *head = new Node(v[0]);
    head->next = new Node(v[1]);
    head->next->next = new Node(v[2]);
    head->next->next->next = new Node(v[3]);
    return 0;
}
```

</PreCard>

## Traversing a linked list 

While we can traverse a linked list using a for loop, it is more common to use a while loop. This is because the size of the linked list is not fixed, and we can't use the size of the linked list as a condition for the for loop.

We traverse a linked list by starting from the head node and on each iteration we actually move to the next node by changing the Current node to the address of the next node.

Lets print the data of each node in the Linked list and also count the number of nodes in the linked list.
<PreCard pwd="LinkedList.cpp">
```cpp
void printList(Node* head){
  Node* ptr = head;
  int count=0;
  while(ptr!=NULL){
    cout<<ptr->data<<" ";
    ptr = ptr->next;
    count++;
  }
  cout<<"Number of nodes in the linked list are: "<<count;
}
```
</PreCard>

we are using a temporary node because if we use the head node we will actually be changing the head node itself and we will lose the reference to the head node.

>We should always use a temporary node to traverse the linked list.


Now, try to implement the following functions on your own:
        - [ ] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [ ] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [ ] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [ ] pop_front() - remove the front item and return its value
        - [ ] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [ ] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [ ] front() - get the value of the front item
        - [ ] back() - get the value of the end item
        - [ ] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so the current item at that index is pointed to by the new item at the index
        - [ ] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [ ] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at the nth position from the end of the list
        - [ ] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [ ] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value

I will be updating this blog in the future with the implementation of these functions.

## Full code for the linked list
<PreCard pwd="LinkedList.cpp">
```cpp
  #include<iostream>
  #include<vector>
  using namespace std;
  class Node{
    public{
      int data;
      Node* next;
    }
  public:
    Node(int val){
      data = val;
      next = nullptr;
  }
    Node(int val, Node* nextNode){
      data = val;
      next = nextNode;
    }
  }

  int main() {
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    Node *head = new Node(v[0]);
    head->next = new Node(v[1]);
    head->next->next = new Node(v[2]);
    head->next->next->next = new Node(v[3]);
    return 0;
}
```
